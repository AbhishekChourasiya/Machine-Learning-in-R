The experience of building ML models in R is amazing. With an incredible active community & libraries support, R makes it 1000 times easier for a beginner to endeavour to pursue machine learning / data science. 

For the purpose of sharing knowledge, this repository introduces you to various machine learning techniques I've learned over a course of period. Some of the technique would include:

1. Bagging
2. Boosting
3. Ensemble
4. Validation Techniques

This repository will also contain material on deep learning and artificial intelligence.
